["What is Requirement Analysis?"]
Requirement Analysis in Software Development.”# requirement-analysis
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. Through a series of well-defined tasks, learners will create a detailed blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.
["Why is Requirement Analysis Important?"]
 it provides the foundational blueprint for a project, ensuring that the final product aligns with stakeholder needs and business goals by identifying and clarifying requirements before development begins
 “Key Activities in Requirement Analysis.”
 
**1. Requirement Gathering**
 Collect initial information from stakeholders. Identify project goals, needs, and expectations. Use surveys, interviews, and observations to obtain data.

**2. Requirement Elicitation**
 Engage stakeholders to uncover detailed needs. Use brainstorming, workshops, and use cases. Focus on understanding hidden or implicit requirements.

**3. Requirement Documentation**
 Record all gathered requirements clearly and precisely. Use requirement specification documents or user stories. Ensure consistency, traceability, and easy understanding.

**4. Requirement Analysis and Modeling**
 Examine requirements for feasibility and completeness. Create models like diagrams or flowcharts to visualize them. Identify conflicts, dependencies, and priorities.

**5. Requirement Validation**
 Confirm requirements meet stakeholder expectations. Conduct reviews, walkthroughs, and prototypes.


**Types of Requirements**

1. **Functional Requirements**
 Define what the system should do. Describe features, functions, and interactions.Example: “The system shall send an email confirmation after registration.”

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**
 Specify how the system performs its functions. Include performance, security, usability, and reliability. Example: “The system must load within three seconds.”

3. **Business Requirements**
Represent high-level objectives of the organization.Focus on business goals and project justification. Example: “Increase online sales by 20% in six months.”

4. **User Requirements**

 Define what end-users need from the system.Often expressed as user stories or scenarios.Example: “As a user, I want to reset my password easily.”

5. **System Requirements**

   * Detail the technical specifications of the system. Include hardware, software, and integration needs. Example: “The system shall run on Windows and macOS platforms.”

6. **Regulatory Requirements**
 Ensure compliance with laws, policies, or standards. Often industry-specific (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).Example: “User data must comply with data protection regulations.”

“Use Case Diagrams.”


A Use Case Diagram is a type of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagram that visually represents the interactions between actors (users or external systems) and a system to achieve specific goals. It focuses on what the system should do rather than how it does it

Benefits of Use Case Diagrams

Clarify System Functionality: Provide a clear overview of what the system does.

Improve Communication: Help stakeholders, developers, and users understand requirements easily.

Define System Scope: Clearly show what is inside and outside the system boundary.


“Acceptance Criteria.”

Acceptance criteria define the specific conditions a feature must meet to be accepted by stakeholders. They ensure clarity, reduce misunderstandings, and guide development and testing. Clear criteria help verify that requirements are fully met and aligned with user expectations.

Example – Checkout Feature (Booking Management System):

User must be able to review booking details before payment.

System must securely process payments via multiple methods.

Confirmation message and receipt must display after successful payment.

Failed transactions must show an error and allow retry


* Ensure accuracy, clarity, and alignment with project goals.
